# agartha

## Objective

`agartha` is a procedural world generator. There is no intention for it to generate purely naturalistic worlds, but rather sufficiently convincing and aesthetically appealing worlds as seen in old-school fantasy games. `agartha` is built around the `tcod` library (among others) with two end goals:

1. A quick, easy means of generating fictional worlds for conlanging/world-building projects.
2. A procedural generator for the (literal) environment of a future game development/simulation project.
